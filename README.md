## Minesweeper

Classic Minesweeper with I suppose some neatish effects.

This uses only [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and extension libraries [SDL_image](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_image/), [SDL_ttf](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_ttf/), (and maybe [SDL_mixer](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_mixer/) in the future).

Built on Unix with Clang or GCC and Windows with MinGW.
